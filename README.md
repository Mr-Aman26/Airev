# Introduction
- Electric vehicles are gaining popularity and market share. In Q2 2022, EV sales accounted for 5.6% of the total auto market (up from 2.7% in Q2 of 2021).
- Clean energy and improved performance are driving people to make the switch to electric.
- Government incentives continue to buttress the future of all things electric.

# Problems

Currently, the infrastructure of charging stations in India is not meeting the requirements of the user. In tier-one cities, there are still enough charging stations but in tier-two and tier-three cities the number is near zero. Due to this, users have to plan their journey carefully keeping fewer charging stations and poor infrastructure in mind.
